# Saitama Robot
A modular telegram Python bot running on python3 with an sqlalchemy database.

Originally a marie fork - Saitama has evolved further and was built to be more useful for Anime Chats. 

Can be found on telegram as [SaitamaRobot](https://t.me/SaitamaRobot).

The Support group can be reached out to at [One Punch Support](https://t.me/OnePunchSupport), where you can ask for help setting up your bot, discover/request new features, report bugs, and stay in the loop whenever a new update is available. 

There is no news channel as of yet, but if we do make one - it will be listed here on this readme. 

## Starting the bot.

Once you've setup your database and your configuration (see below) is complete, simply run:

`python3 -m tg_bot`

## Setting up the bot (Read this before trying to use!):
Given this is a Marie Fork, its optimal that you follow the setup procedure as stated on [Marie](https://github.com/PaulSonOfLars/tgbot/blob/master/README.md)

You can use [nssm](https://nssm.cc/usage) to install the bot as service on windows and set it to restart on /gitpull 
Make sure to edit the start and restart bats to your needs. 
Note: the restar bat requires that User account control is disabled.

For queries or any issues, please open an issue ticket or visit us at [@OnePunchSupport](https://t.me/onepunchsupport)
## Credits
The bot is based of on the original work done by [PaulSonOfLars](https://github.com/PaulSonOfLars)
It was just revamped to suit an Anime centric community. All original credits go to him. Without his work, this fork would not have been possible!
